# Tibia helper ⚔️
**Tibia Helper** is my first project built entirely around an API as the main data source. After completing Taskingo, I wondered what challenge to take on next—and decided to focus on an API-based project. Thanks to my solid understanding of React and prior experience with fetching and displaying API data, I didn’t encounter many difficulties during development. The key advantage of this application is its accessibility—virtually anyone can use Tibia Helper to check up-to-date, essential information about the world of this MMORPG. With a clean and user-friendly design, the website ensures a visually appealing experience while allowing users to navigate seamlessly and find the information they need.
